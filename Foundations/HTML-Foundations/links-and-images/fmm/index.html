    <h1>Four image format used in the Web</h1>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>JPG</strong>
        <p>
            JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly 
            increasing file size.

      <li>
        <strong>PNG</strong>
        <p>
            PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo or animated. 
            For photos, a PNG file of the same quality <em>(as perceived the human eye)</em> would 
            generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file. However, they do deal with 
            opacity just fine, and they don't have color palette limitations. 
            This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.
        </p>

        image format">

        <strong>GIF</strong>
        <p>
            GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that 
            they're somewhat limited in terms of color paletteâ€”never use them for photos.

      <li>
        <strong>SVG</strong>
        <p>
            Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics 
            format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality.
             This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design. 
             They're good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and you should use
            them whenever you can.
