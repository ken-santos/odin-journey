    <h1 lang="en">How sinking carbon-storing seaweed can help fight climate change</h1>
    <p lang="en">By: <em>Patric J. Kiger</em> | July 12, 2022</p>

        <p>
        Climate change, driven primarily by human activity that pumps large amounts of 
        carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, already is having observable effects all over 
        the planet, and scientists fear it will have <strong>catastrophic impacts</strong> 
        impacts by the end of this century, from increasingly violent storms and brutal 
        heat waves to <strong>rising sea levels</strong> that will inundate coastlines.</p>

        <p>
        But as climate activists and politicians grapple over how aggressively carbon 
        emissions need to be reduced to stave off what many see as an existential threat, 
        a group of volunteer visionaries called Pull to Refresh is proposing an ingenious 
        alternative solution. They want to use seaweed — specifically, the vast quantities 
        of macroscopic algae such as kelp and sargassum which occur naturally in our 
        oceans — to absorb carbon emissions from the atmosphere and store the carbon.</p>
    </p>

    <h3>The Pull to Refresh Plan</h3>

    <p>
        Pull to Refresh — which cleverly takes its name from a familiar touch-screen 
        gesture — would do this by deploying a fleet of robotic, solar-powered vessels 
        to roam the oceans. In the Caribbean, the autonomous craft would sink the existing, 
        plentiful masses of sargassum, so that the carbon would be stored on the ocean bottom, 
        explains Arin Crumley, filmmaker, entrepreneur and CEO of Pull to Refresh. 
        In the Pacific, similar robots could cultivate kelp forests in remote areas, 
        growing the carbon-absorbing algae on trellises and eventually sinking it in the 
        deep ocean, as this 2021 Technology Review article describes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Crumley, who in addition to directing and producing films has imported parts 
        for electric skateboards, says that Pull to Refresh grew out of a discussion group 
        on Clubhouse, a social media app, which brought together a bunch of climate-minded 
        talent from a variety of fields, ranging from creative media types to engineers.
    </p>

    <p>
        "All of the people who came together have been wanting to do something about 
        climate change for a long time, but weren't sure what that could be," Crumley 
        explains via Zoom. They coalesced around a goal of entering in the XPrize Carbon 
        Removal competition, which offers $100 million in funding for the competitor with
        the best idea for fighting climate change.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initially, Crumley and the others looked at finding a way to capture carbon 
        directly from the air, until they hit upon the idea of seaweed as a carbon storage 
        medium. "It just turned out that you can get so much farther by utilizing 
        photosynthesis and the open ocean," Crumley says. Eventually, the team realized that 
        "we just need a thing that floats around and can go out to do the stuff that needs 
        to be done."
    </p>

    <p>
        For Crumley, it all clicked. "It's basically a giant electric skateboard," he says.
        Relatively giant, that is — Crumley says the robotic vessels might start in size 
        at 8 meters (26 feet) in length by 6.6 feet (2 meters) across. 
        "It has all the same components. You've got a main battery pack, the main electronic
        components, a couple of different motors. And it's just a kind of blown-up enlarged 
        version of what I was pretty familiar with already."

    <h3>Unmanned Vessels Are Key</h3>

    <p>
        <p>"My background is not in electronics or mechanical engineering, 
        or any of these specific realms of expertise, but just in understanding how it all 
        works," he continues. "What all the components are, what different talents are 
        involved, what kind of teams get certain things done. It became clear that there was
        no reason we couldn't design an unmanned vessel that would do the work."</p>

        <p>Using unmanned vessels is key, Crumley says, because they eliminate the need to 
            have "huge crews out really far from the coastline. Because you need to get to 
            where there's enough depth. So you can't operate anywhere near the coast. 
            So now you're talking danger, you're talking very high salaries, you're talking 
            about people missing their loved ones for months and months."</p>

    <h3>From Growing Kelp to Harvesting Sargassum</h3>

    <p>
        <p>Initially, Pull to Refresh focused upon the idea of growing kelp in the Pacific. 
        "So that was kind of our initial prototyping and development that we did," explains 
        Laurel Tincher, another of the organization's leaders. But the focus recently has 
        shifted from kelp to Caribbean sargassum, in part because it provids an opportunity 
        to have an impact not just on climate change, but upon another environmental problem 
        as well.</p>

        <p>"We also came across this really massive issue of invasive sargassum in the 
        Caribbean," Tincher says. "Really, in the past 10 years it has become a huge problem.
        And we thought, well, there's already all of this seaweed out there, this is already 
        carbon that's been captured. Let's do something with this. And so we kind of pivoted 
        to create this stepping stone where we have a vessel that can drive around and gather 
        up that sargassum and sink that. So that can really help us to prove out a lot of 
        different aspects of our technology that will ultimately be used in both systems but 
        can also help solve this forgotten problem."</p>

        <p>If the sargassum is allowed to wash up on beaches, it not only is an eyesore, 
            but the carbon in the sargassum eventually can be released in the form of 
            methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Instead, by 
            lowering the sargassum into the water, the algae eventually becomes compressed 
            and loses its buoyancy, so that it can sink to the bottom, according to Crumley.
        </p>

        <p>To actually make a serious dent in the Earth's atmospheric carbon, Pull to 
            Refresh would have to put a lot of robotic vessels out in the world's 
            oceans — perhaps as many as a billion. "I understand that's a crazy 
            number," Crumley says. But he also notes that it's the equivalent of a decade's 
            worth of production in the global automobile industry. With a sufficiently broad 
            base of support, "it's doable," he insists.
