      This is the place where you'll find all the hardwares that
      you need to fix, maintain, and build electronics. (I know
      this is not the right place to put the websites Description,
      but I'm just testing things out because this is the place
      where user can easily see what this website is, I'm making
      it easier for the user what this website is all about, but
      maybe this is not the right way to do it).
